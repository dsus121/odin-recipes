    <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>When tiny green asparagus tips start peeking through the ground, we say Colorado's spring produce season has officially begun. Fresh asparagus offers a delicious crispness to complement any meal. When paired with some citrus flavors, you can really elevate the experience for your taste buds. This particular recipe also uses honey, a popular sweetener produced throughout Colorado. Check out your local honey supplier or support Colorado honey through your next grocery store purchase.</p>
        <p>
        We can enjoy asparagus all year long, but it is at its most delicious and nutritious when in season. Native to the Eastern Mediterranean region, asparagus has been cultivated for at least 2,000 years. It is one of the few vegetables that is a perennial, which means that it does not need to be planted each year; the plants live around 15 years or more. Colorado has a thriving wild asparagus population, often a closely held secret for the asparagus pickers among us.</p>
        <p>
        You will see farm raised asparagus from April to June at your local farmers markets, farm stands, and retail grocers. When buying asparagus, choose odorless stalks with dry, tight tips and avoid limp or wilted stalks. Asparagus is fat free, sodium free, a good source of vitamin C, high in folate, and a good source of vitamin A, according to Colorado State University Extension.</p>
